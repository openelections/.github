## Welcome to OpenElections!

The goal of OpenElections is to create the first free, comprehensive, standardized, linked set of election data for the United States, including federal, statewide and state legislative offices. The current options for election data can be difficult to find and use or financially out-of-reach for most journalists and civic hackers. We want the people who work with election data to be able to get what they need, whether that's for stories and data analysis or web applications and interactive graphics.

OpenElections is a volunteer project, which means you can help us collect and convert official precinct results data. It was co-founded by Serdar Tumgoren and Derek Willis in 2012 and is managed by Willis, a lecturer in data journalism at the University of Maryland. OpenElections gratefully accepts donations online (use [this form](https://fundraise.givesmart.com/form/qycOsg?vid=wg9yg), putting "OpenElections" in the line for specific fund) and funding goes directly towards acquiring and converting official election results into data. OpenElections data has been used by The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, several academic projects and other organizations. The data is and will remain free to anyone.
